🌱 Fertilizer Recommendation System using AI (Deep Learning)
This project uses deep learning to recommend the best fertilizer based on soil quality, crop type, and environmental conditions. The model analyzes data and provides optimal fertilizer suggestions to improve yield.
📌 Features
✅ AI-powered fertilizer recommendations
✅ Uses soil, crop, and weather data
✅ Built with Deep Learning (TensorFlow/keras)
✅ Web interface for user-friendly access

Here’s an updated explanation incorporating **plant disease detection** using **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** in your **Fertilizer Recommendation System**:  

---

## **🧪 How It Works**  

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**  
- **Inputs**: Plant leaf images, soil nutrients, crop type, weather conditions.  
- **Dataset**: Labeled images of diseased and healthy plants, along with soil parameters.  

### **2️⃣ Preprocessing**  
- **Image Processing**: Resize, normalize, and augment plant images for better model accuracy.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove noise and handle missing values in soil and weather datasets.  

### **3️⃣ Model Training** (Deep Learning with CNNs)  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are used to classify plant diseases based on leaf images.  
- **Fully Connected Layers** are used to map disease classification to **fertilizer recommendations & precautions**.  
- **Training Data**: Labeled images of plant diseases + soil properties.  
- **Frameworks Used**: TensorFlow/Keras.  

### **4️⃣ Prediction & Recommendation**  
- The model takes an **image of a plant leaf** as input.  
- It detects the **disease (if any)** and suggests the **best fertilizer & precautions**.  
- If the plant is healthy, it provides **general fertilizer recommendations** based on soil & weather data.  

### **5️⃣ Deployment (Web App/API)**  
- A **Flask or FastAPI web application** allows users to upload plant images.  
- The AI model predicts the **disease** and suggests **fertilizers & treatment methods**.  
- The system can be accessed via a web browser or mobile app.
